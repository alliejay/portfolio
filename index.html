              <blockquote>"Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful."</blockquote>
                <h4>Albert Schweitzer</h4>

                <p>
                  Albert Schweitzer's quote regarding success and happiness embodies the ideals which I believe whole-heartedly, and which have changed my life for the better in this past year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  I graduated from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in 2012 and shortly thereafter started a career in the Cell Tower Industry. While I enjoyed my role as a Lease Analyst, and I had the utmost respect for my managers & co-workers, I (like most) am not overwhelmingly interested in steel structures. I found myself envying those who went to work every day truly loving what they did.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  I moved from Boston, MA (where I had lived my entire life) to Charleston, SC in March of 2015 and shortly after stopped working at the cell tower company.  It was the perfect time to change career paths and choose a field that I have an organic interest in.  It quickly became apparent that web development & design brings out a side of me I hadn't seen in years. I got excited to go to school every day and learn more about the amazing things I would become capable of as a front end engineer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  I was enrolled at <a href="http://www.theironyard.com" target="_blank">The Iron Yard</a> for their Fall 2015 Cohort in Front End Development, and graduated on January 8th. I was offered a job immediately following Graduation/Demo Day as a Front End Engineer for a Department of Defense contractor beginning in February 2016.

        <h2>PORTFOLIO</h2>
        <p class="snippet">
          Aside from my day job, I am currently working on an exciting new project with three other developers.  Our application aims to better the lives of others by spreading knowledge and positivity - but I won't say any more than that! The details of our innovative new app will be under wraps until the project is closer to being completed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="snippet">
          Below is a listing of the assignments and projects I worked on while a student at The Iron Yard.  With each, I've included the goal of the assignment, any challenges our instructors (intentionally) threw our way, and my own personal experience as well.  Each screenshot will take you to either the deployed application or to its GitHub repo.
