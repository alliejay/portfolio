              <blockquote>"Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful."</blockquote>

                <h2>ABOUT ALISON</h2>
                <p>
                  Albert Schweitzer's quote regarding success and happiness embodies the ideals which I believe whole-heartedly, and which have changed my life for the better in this past year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  I graduated from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in 2012 and shortly thereafter started a career in the Cell Tower Industry as a Lease Analyst.  While I enjoyed the many responsibilities that I was given at this job, and I had the utmost respect for my managers & co-workers, I did not have an organic interest in steel structures. I found myself envying those around me who went to work every day loving what they did.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Since envy is an ugly trait, I decided to do something about my circumstances.  After moving from Boston, MA (where I had lived my entire life) to Charleston, SC in March of 2015, I explored other career options.  It quickly became apparent that web development and web design bring out a side of me I hadn't seen in many years. I get excited to go to school every day and learn more about this field and the amazing ways we can all make the internet, and therefore the world, a better place.

                  I am currently enrolled at <a href="http://www.theironyard.com" target="_blank">The Iron Yard</a> for their Fall 2015 - Front End Engineering Cohort and will be graduating on January 8th.  I intend to update my website with projects that I've worked on at school, blog posts regarding struggles & learning moments, along with some other personal information about myself.
